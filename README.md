# ppsloop
Demo animation effect for new home page

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/greenglobal/ppsloop.git
cd ppsloop
yarn
npm start
```

If everything goes well, it would build a compiled version to "/dist", open at 8080 and start watching changes. 

To dev, just modify source codes from /src, then reload webpage to see updates.
